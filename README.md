# JTSDK64 Tools

This repository is designed to work specifically with the
[JTSDK64 Tools Version 3.1.0][] or later.

## Documentation

The project has a new [Documentation Site][] hosted on `Github.io`.
The documents cover all aspects of the project, from
[installation](#installaiton) to beta testing. Going forward, the documentation
site will be the most up to date information available.

## Software Delivery

Delivery is directly from the `master` branch. `Branches` are used for development
and testing, while reserving the `master` branch in a stable condition for end
users. `Tags` are used to archive milestones, and will appear in the
[release section][].

## Community Support

To assist users with installation, usage, compiling applications, and
general discussion, use:

See [Windows Installation][] for detailed instructions.

## Bug Reports

For submitting bug reports and feature requests, use the [Issue Tracker][].

The aim of `JTSDK-Tools` is to use an Agile delivery approach to create a
high-quality, yet flexible build system. Utilizing Github's [Issue Tracker][].
users can quickly see the status of any particular request, discuss the merits,
and implement the final disposition.

## Supported OS

At present, this repository only supports Windows. Later releases with include
generic Linux support, and additional Ubuntu / Debian specific artifacts.

- Windows
  - Win-10 x86-64
  - Win-7|8 x86-64
  - Win-XP and Vista are not supported.

## System Requirements

This project creates a development-environment that supports many languages.
Performance has a direct Correlation to system resources. While it is possible
to build applications on marginal systems, using minimal hardware will lead to
lengthy compiling times and sub-par system performance. With that in
mind, the following should be considered the bare-minimum requirements:

- CPU: 2x Cores @ 2.5+ Ghz. (More Cores + Higher Clock Rates) = Better Performance
- RAM: 4GB Minimum
- Disk Space: At least 25GB to 30GB of Free Space
- SSD - If you have them, use them!
